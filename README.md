### Misconceptions.

Two people,

Two people embracing each other’s bodies.

Two people,

Clinging onto each other –

Filling themselves with one another’s breath.

Two people just grasping at the chance to feel whole.

Love is in body and in soul,

It is almost completely out of our control

Problematic at best for young lovers.

Made to believe that you need another to complete you,

Truth is that we are made complete

Already one within ourselves;

Our very being forged from the destruction of the beauty in our universe.

As souls

We are energy,

Energy that cannot be created or destroyed.

Another’s company can very well be preferred

But not used to fill that mental void

In which your mind has created.

As –

People are NOT medicine

Especially not

For your incurable bouts of needy loneliness.

Just as

Love is not a sustainable cure for your emptiness.

You are made to believe that

pouring yourself into another

Will help you feel whole.

But when reality hits you it feels like shit

Because your prescription

Has expired.

Access to your stardust medicine

Has been cut.

You poured so much of your being into them

That now

Your withered soul and body is left contemplating,

Wandering,

If that lipstick on your cigarette butt is all that remains of your existence.
